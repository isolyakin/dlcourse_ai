    "our dataset. We will create a rapper class for our dataset using\n",
    "``torch.utils.data.Dataset`` that will handle loading the files and\n",
    "performing some formatting steps. The UrbanSound8K dataset is separated\n",
    "into 10 folders. We will use the data from 9 of these folders to train\n",
    "our network and then use the 10th folder to test the network. The rapper\n",
    "class will store the file names, labels, and folder numbers of the audio\n",
    "files in the inputted folder list when initialized. The actual loading\n",
    "and formatting steps will happen in the access function ``__getitem__``.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ``__getitem__``, we use ``torchaudio.load()`` to convert the wav\n",
    "files to tensors. ``torchaudio.load()`` returns a tuple containing the\n",
    "newly created tensor along with the sampling frequency of the audio file\n",
    "(44.1kHz for UrbanSound8K). The dataset uses two channels for audio so\n",
    "we will use ``torchaudio.transforms.DownmixMono()`` to convert the audio\n",
    "data to one channel. Next, we need to format the audio data. The network\n",
    "we will make takes an input size of 32,000, while most of the audio\n",
    "files have well over 100,000 samples. The UrbanSound8K audio is sampled\n",
    "at 44.1kHz, so 32,000 samples only covers around 700 milliseconds. By\n",
    "downsampling the audio to aproximately 8kHz, we can represent 4 seconds\n",
    "with the 32,000 samples. This downsampling is achieved by taking every\n",
    "fifth sample of the original audio tensor. Not every audio tensor is\n",
    "long enough to handle the downsampling so these tensors will need to be\n",
